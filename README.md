# SelfDrivingNetwork

An experimental convolutional neural network for autonomous driving in Keras, intended to be used with a Unity simulation, which unfortunately I cannot release because it includes proprietary assets from the Asset Store.

Most of this should be understandable, except for some specific linking code in `infer.py`. If you download this, go ahead and adapt the file to your needs.

I hope this code helps someone, even if just used as an example for a regression convolutional neural network in Keras. Enjoy!
